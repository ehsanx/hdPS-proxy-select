# Background



**Aim**: The aim of this research is to systematically evaluate and compare different proxy selection methods within the context of high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) analysis. Specifically, the study focuses on assessing how these methods, including alternative variable selection approaches, perform in selecting proxy variables for confounding adjustment compared to the traditional Bross method within the hdPS framework. We seek to determine whether these alternative methods offer superior performance in estimating treatment effects compared to the default Bross formula.

# Methods

## Data and Simulation {-}

**Motivating Example**: To explore the relationship between obesity and the risk of diabetes, we revisited this association using data from three cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2018 [@karim2024high]. This analysis was informed by a thorough review of the existing literature [@saydah2014trends;@liu2013association;@kabadi2012joint;@ostchega2012abdominal]. To identify relevant covariates, we constructed a causal diagram based on established causal inference principles [@greenland1999causal]. The covariates included in our analysis were carefully selected and categorized into Demographic, Behavioral, Health History, Access-related, and Laboratory variables [@karim2024high]. While most of these variables were binary or categorical, the Laboratory variables were continuous.

**Plasmode simulation**: To rigorously assess the performance of the methods under consideration, we employed a plasmode simulation framework, which is particularly well-suited for reflecting real-world data structures and complexities [@franklin2014plasmode]. This approach was modeled after the analytic dataset derived from NHANES and involved resampling from the observed covariates and exposure information (i.e., obesity) without altering them. By mirroring key aspects of an actual epidemiological study, this simulation framework offers a significant advantage over traditional Monte Carlo simulations, which often rely on idealized assumptions. 

**Simulation scenarios under consideration**: Our plasmode simulation was conducted over 500 iterations. For the base simulation scenario, we set the prevalence of exposure (obesity) and the event rate (diabetes) at 30%, with a true odds ratio (OR) parameter of 1, corresponding to a risk difference (RD) of 0. Each simulated dataset had a sample size of 3,000 participants. The description of other scenarios under consideration is provided in Table \ref{table:scenarios}.

**True Data Generating Mechanism Used in Plasmode Simulation**: The primary goal of this study is to evaluate various variable selection methods under realistic conditions. To achieve this, we formulated the outcome data based on a specific model specification that incorporates both exposure and covariates, including investigator-specified and proxy variables. The model specification consists of three key components:

1. *Investigator-Specified Covariates*: We retained the original investigator-specified covariates, which were either binary or categorical, reflecting how real-world studies typically operate.

2. *Transformation of Laboratory Variables*: In real-world studies, it is common for analysts to lack precise knowledge of the true model specification. To simulate this uncertainty, we transformed the continuous laboratory variables using complex functions such as logarithmic, exponential, square root, polynomial transformations, and interactions. This reflects the challenges analysts face in correctly specifying models when dealing with continuous data.

3. *Inclusion of Proxy Variables*: Real-world studies often deal with unmeasured confounding, which researchers attempt to mitigate by adding proxy variables. However, when a large number of proxies are added, some may act as noise variables, contributing little to the analysis. To simulate this, we selected only those binary proxy covariates (referred to as recurrence covariates in hdPS terminology) that had a relative risk (RR) of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2 concerning the outcome. Out of 143 proxy covariates, 94 met this criterion and were included in calculating a simple comorbidity burden measure. The remaining 49 covariates were excluded from this calculation and considered noise. This comorbidity burden measure was then incorporated into our model specification for generating the plasmode data.

**Performance Measures**: From this simulation, we derived several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods under consideration: (1) bias, (2) average model standard error (SE; the average of estimated SEs obtained from a model over repeated samples), (3) empirical SE (the standard deviation of estimated treatment effects across repeated samples), (4) mean squared error (MSE), (5) coverage probability of 95% confidence intervals, (6) bias-corrected coverage, and (7) Zip plot [@morris2019using; @white2023check].

## Estimators under consideration {-} 

The comparison between the data generation process and the analysis process reveals two key differences: (i) The data generation used transformed laboratory variables, whereas the analysis was conducted using only the original laboratory variables. (ii) The data generation employed a simple sum of selected proxy variables (sum of 94 proxy covariates), while the analysis included all proxy variables (143 binary proxies), with 49 of these acting as noise variables. These differences help us assess how the proxy variable selection methods handle model misspecification and the presence of noise variables.

1. **Kitchen sink model**: This is a base model for comparison, where no variable selection approaches were used. All investigator-selected features and all proxy variables were used to model [@karim2018can].  

2. **Bross formula**: The Bross formula is a statistical method used to calculate the bias introduced by not adjusting for a covariate [@bross1966spurious]. In hdPS analysis, this formula was originally applied to each proxy variable to measure and rank the potential bias if the covariate were not adjusted for. In our analysis, the 100 proxies with the highest bias rankings are selected for further modeling [@schneeweiss2009high; @wyss2018erratum].

3. **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)**: LASSO is a variable selection technique that limits the number of variables by adding a penalty term to the regression model. Cross-validation (CV) is used in LASSO to identify variables with non-zero coefficients in the best model by optimizing the penalty value [@franklin2015regularized; @schneeweiss2017variable; @karim2018can].

4. **Hybrid of hdPS and LASSO**: Instead of relying solely on LASSO for variable selection, a hybrid approach combines the Bross formula and LASSO. First, hdPS variables are selected using the hdPS algorithm (e.g., the top 100), and then LASSO is applied to further refine the selection [@karim2018can; @franklin2015regularized].

5. **Elasticnet**: Elastic Net is an extension of LASSO that includes an additional penalty term to handle multicollinearity by grouping correlated features and selecting the most representative ones [@karim2018can].

6. **Random Forest**: The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees to perform classification [@breiman2001random]. It calculates the importance of each proxy variable based on the decrease in impurity or Gini importance, providing a ranking of the proxies. The top 100 variables from this ranking are manually selected for further modeling [@schneeweiss2017variable].

7. **XGBoost**: XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm used to optimize machine learning models [@chen2016xgboost]. It builds decision trees that make splits based on maximum impurity reduction, and it assigns an importance score to each proxy variable by calculating the mean decrease in impurity [@xiao2024interpretable].

8. **Stepwise**: Stepwise selection is a progressive feature selection method that can proceed in two directions—forward or backward—based on the maximum adjusted R-squared. We have implemented two versions: (a) Forward selection (FS) starts with an initial model (e.g., including all investigator-selected features) and adds proxies to the model one at a time. (b) Backward elimination (BE) starts with a full model (e.g., all investigator-selected features and all proxy variables) and removes features one at a time based on their contribution to the model.

9. **Genetic algorithm (GA)**: GA is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by the theory of natural selection [@holland1975adaptation]. It operates by evolving offspring from a population of the fittest individuals over several generations, evaluating and selecting the best combination of features or variables that maximize prediction accuracy.
